# First of, I just wanna say thank you for purchasing this plugin! If you have
# not paid for it, and got it from a shady place, then shame on you. I also want
# to thank all the people who have supported and bought this plugin from the
# beginning. You have been patient with your requests, and I have been busy.
# You deserve a new, and better version. :)
